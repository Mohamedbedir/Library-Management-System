Creating a Library Management System (LMS) using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) involves defining the system's requirements and then designing classes that model the entities and their interactions within the system. Here are the key requirements and corresponding OOP concepts that can be used to implement a basic LMS

OOP Concepts and Design
To implement these requirements using OOP, we can define several classes and relationships:

Classes:

Book: Represents a book in the library.
Properties: Title, Author, ISBN, Genre, NumberOfCopies, AvailableCopies, etc.
Methods: UpdateBookInfo(), CheckAvailability(), etc.
User: Represents a library user.
Properties: Name, UserID, ContactInfo, BorrowingHistory, Role, etc.
Methods: Register(), UpdateInfo(), BorrowBook(), ReturnBook(), etc.
Admin: Inherits from User, with additional privileges.
Methods: AddBook(), RemoveBook(), GenerateReport(), etc.
Librarian: Inherits from User, with specific responsibilities like managing inventory.
BorrowTransaction: Represents the borrowing of a book.
Properties: TransactionID, Book, User, BorrowDate, DueDate, ReturnDate, Fine, etc.
Library: Manages the collection of books and users.
Properties: Books, Users, Transactions, etc.
Methods: AddBook(), RegisterUser(), SearchBook(), IssueBook(), ReturnBook(), etc.


Relationships:
User and Book have a many-to-many relationship via BorrowTransaction.
Admin and Librarian are specialized types of User (inheritance).
Library acts as an aggregate root that manages the collection of Book and User objects.
